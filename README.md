# Using NLP to Summarize Long Text Files
This idea stemmed from an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/report-is-too-long-to-read-use-nlp-to-create-a-summary-6f5f7801d355) by Louis Teo

The program takes a text file and returns a summary of the file containing the three most important sentences. To see how it works, take a look at the Summarize.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

## Instructions:
1. Save any articles or long text to a .txt file in the NLP-Summarize/text_files directory. Remember the name of the file.
2. From your computer's terminal, navigate to the NLP-Summarize directory
3. Enter the following command in terminal: ``python3 summarize.py``
